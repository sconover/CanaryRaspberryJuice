- include guava in "main" pluing module...
  ...needs a pom.


- extract command methods and annotate
  - annotations that mark original / extended
  - api doc annotations
  - transform the annotations to api docs as part of the mvn package (put in the jar?)

- maven
  - run "mvn dependency:sources" to get dependency jar sources
- look into https://travis-ci.org/
- running canarymod as a config...
  net.canarymod.Main
  -Djava.awt.headless=true

  ...canarymod submodule?

  git submodule add git@github.com:sconover/CanaryMod.git submodules/CanaryMod

- integration test the mcpi stuff
  - iterate by running tests...and watching them run in-world
    ...reload the plugin on the fly?
    ...print the test name in chat
    ...print each command?
    shouldn't need to disconnect client
      ...need to use plugin reloading capability
      ...start server in background, reload plugin at the beginning of each test run
        small socket server that responds to a single command (reloadPlugin name)
          ...use all the plugin reloading capabilities (just avoid jars)
          print in-game
      only reload if the hash of the file contents is different (and, log either way)

  - slow them down or speed them up

  - later: examine the world files via NBT
    ...canonical AT's for any mcpi plugin?

- test game config - should be in creative mode and login timeout is huge

- ...in-game debugger...step through commands and watch what happens. control from console, in-game.
